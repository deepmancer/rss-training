    <summary>üìù Click for Abstract</summary>

We propose a **novel framework** for incorporating **unlabeled data** into semi-supervised classification problems, where scenarios involving the minimization of either:

- *i)* adversarially robust, or 
- *ii)* non-robust loss functions 

have been considered. Notably, we allow the unlabeled samples to deviate slightly (in the total variation sense) from the in-domain distribution. The core idea behind our framework is to combine **Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO)** with **self-supervised training**. As a result, we also leverage **efficient polynomial-time algorithms** for the training stage.

From a theoretical standpoint, we apply our framework to the classification problem of a **mixture of two Gaussians** in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where, in addition to the $m$ independent and labeled samples from the true distribution, a set of $n$ (usually with $n \gg m$) out-of-domain and unlabeled samples are also provided.

Using only the labeled data, it is known that the generalization error can be bounded by:

$$\propto \left(\frac{d}{m}\right)^{1/2}.$$

However, using our method on both isotropic and non-isotropic Gaussian mixture models, one can derive a new set of **analytically explicit and non-asymptotic bounds** which show substantial improvement in the generalization error compared to ERM.

Our results underscore two significant insights:

1. Out-of-domain samples, even when unlabeled, can be harnessed to narrow the generalization gap, provided that the true data distribution adheres to a form of the <em>"cluster assumption"</em>.
2. The semi-supervised learning paradigm can be regarded as a special case of our framework when there are no distributional shifts.

We validate our claims through experiments conducted on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.

## ‚ú® Method: Robust Self Supervised (RSS) Training

The **Robust Self-Supervised (RSS) Training framework** enhances the ERM loss function by incorporating a robust regularization term. This additional term exclusively leverages out-of-domain unlabeled data, guiding the classifier away from crowded, dense regions to improve overall performance and robustness.

## üí• Contributions

We propose a polynomial-time framework that leverages both labeled and slightly out-of-domain unlabeled data. Our framework guarantees improved generalization under the *cluster assumption* of the true data distribution. In the well-studied setting of the two-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for classification, with $m$ labeled and $n$ unlabeled data points, our theoretical findings demonstrate:

- **Non-asymptotic bounds** for both robust and non-robust learning.
- **Enhanced generalization** over ERM techniques when $n \geq \Omega(m^2/d)$.
- **Dimension-independent** sample complexity under well-defined conditions.
- **Improved sample complexity** from $O(d/\epsilon^2)$ to $O(d/\epsilon)$ when $n = O(d/\epsilon^6)$.
