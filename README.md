We propose a novel framework for incorporating unlabeled data into semi-supervised classification problems, where scenarios involving the minimization of either:

- *i)* adversarially robust, or 
- *ii)* non-robust loss functions 

have been considered. Notably, we allow the unlabeled samples to deviate slightly (in the total variation sense) from the in-domain distribution. The core idea behind our framework is to combine **Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO)** with **self-supervised training**. As a result, we also leverage **efficient polynomial-time algorithms** for the training stage.

From a theoretical standpoint, we apply our framework to the classification problem of a mixture of two Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where, in addition to the $m$ independent and labeled samples from the true distribution, a set of $n$ (usually with $n \gg m$) out-of-domain and unlabeled samples are also provided.

Using only the labeled data, it is known that the generalization error can be bounded by:

$$\propto \left(\frac{d}{m}\right)^{1/2}.$$

However, using our method on both isotropic and non-isotropic Gaussian mixture models, one can derive a new set of analytically explicit and non-asymptotic bounds which show substantial improvement in the generalization error compared to ERM.

Our results underscore two significant insights:

1. Out-of-domain samples, even when unlabeled, can be harnessed to narrow the generalization gap, provided that the true data distribution adheres to a form of the *"cluster assumption"*.
2. The semi-supervised learning paradigm can be regarded as a special case of our framework when there are no distributional shifts.

We validate our claims through experiments conducted on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.

## üí° Methodology: Robust Self-Supervised (RSS) Training

The **Robust Self-Supervised (RSS) Training framework** enhances the ERM loss function by incorporating a robust regularization term. This term leverages out-of-domain unlabeled data, guiding the classifier away from crowded, dense regions to improve overall performance and robustness.

## ‚ú® Key Contributions

Our work introduces a polynomial-time framework that effectively integrates both labeled and slightly out-of-domain unlabeled data to improve generalization. Key contributions include:

- **Non-asymptotic bounds** for both robust and non-robust learning scenarios.
- **Enhanced generalization** over traditional ERM techniques, particularly when $n \geq \Omega(m^2/d)$.
- **Dimension-independent** sample complexity under specific conditions.
- **Improved sample complexity** from $O(d/\epsilon^2)$ to $O(d/\epsilon)$ when $n = O(d/\epsilon^6)$.
